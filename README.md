<font size ='5'><b>LIST COMPREHENSION AND GENERATORS<b><font>

This repository was created for those that want to learn the basics of list comprehension and generators and to run a simple project where I will try to work with both as much as possible. 

At the moment I have not chosen the dataset to use but I have added a simple notebook where you can start with some very basics. 

The reason for me to do this is because I have been using a lot of "for loops" in the past, and if you are reading this, I'm sure as me, you know that they are inefficient, both computationally and in terms of time and space and this comes to the light when we use proper data, or anything just a bit larger than the normal ones for the exercises when we are leaning how to code. 

I will try to update this soon with the project which I will do by steps but it won't include a full DS workflow. The cleaning, feature engineering and EDA will be all done previous to this.
